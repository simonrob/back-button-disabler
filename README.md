# Back Button Disabler

Have you ever spent time crafting content in a complex web app, only for a careless swipe of your mouse or trackpad to unintentionally navigate back and cause you to lose it all?

This quick and simple extension tries to fix that. Edit the regular expression list in `disable_back_button.js` to add your own site filters, and add to Chrome via "Load unpacked" (in developer mode).

Pull requests and improvements very welcome.
